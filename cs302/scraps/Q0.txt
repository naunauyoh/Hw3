Scenario 1: 
Bob and Toom are both working together but find an answer for Q3 so they
ask Hanna for an advice. 
She helps them but do not give the answer.
Thanks to Hanna's advice they are able to complete Q3.
Here none of the three has violated the copyright and collaboration policy of the course.

Scenario 2: 
Bob and Anne used github for their assignment but Tom will re-use their 
answers and submits them with small modifications. 
Here all three are responsible and have violated 
the copyright and collaboration policy of the course.
The reason is : Bob and Anne should never had used a public repository 
for their assignment and Tom shouldn't have taken their answers.

Scenario 3 :
John and Matt are stuck on Q4 so they ask help from Abbey, who sends them her
solutions. They all submit their solutions to Q4.
Here Abbey, even if she was asked for help should never
have send her answer in OCaml to John and Matt. 
She has violated the copyright and collaboration policy of the course.
We should note that we don't know if John and Matt 
have used Abbey's answer in order to answer Q4, 
which means we cannot say if they are guilty or not.
